# IterApp - Mobile Event Tracking and Discovery

## What is IterApp?
Many apps make scheduling and inviting coworkers and friends to events easier.
However, very few are able to handle events that travel. IterApp addresses this
problem by allowing you to find an event that is in progress and to track the
location of an event as it happens.

## Dependencies
Building IterApp from source requires a number of third-party libraries:

* [Parse SDK](https://www.parse.com/docs/android_guide)
* [Facebook SDK](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/)
* [Google Play Services](http://developer.android.com/google/play-services/setup.html)
